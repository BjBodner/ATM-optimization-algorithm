# ATM-optimization-algorithm
An optimization algorithm for high dimensional problems, such as those found in machine learning and physical sciences.

the ATM algorithm is designed to minimize functions which input a vector or parameters and output a single scalar value. (such as cost functions in machine learning).
Examples of how to use call the optimizer are in the file titled " Example_Of_Calling_Adaptive_To_Mode_Optimizer.py".
We invite users to try to use this optimizer on different optimization problems and find as many issues as you can. This will help us improve the optimizer in future versions.



Future versions will (hopefully) include:
1. More customization: ability to set the number of iterations, set a threshold for convergence, number of parallelized function evaluations and more..
2. Examples of optimizing nerual networks using numpy
2. Examples of optimizing nerual networks using PyTorch
3. Examples of optimizing nerual networks using Tensorflow
